# CS-330: Comp Graphic and Visualization

### How do I approach designing software?
The approach I take to designing software is taking care of one task at a time in order to achieve a larger end goal. This approach applies heavily to this course, in which we worked on a different aspect of the final project each week. In week 2, we started by selecting a 2D image to replicate within a 3D environment. In week 3, we began constructing 3D shapes within our scene. Week 4, we added and modified some camera movement features, allowing the user to navigate the scene using their mouse and keyboard. Week 5, we added textures to the 3D shapes. Week 6, we added lighting to our 3D environment. All of these tasks were required to complete the final project in week 7.

### How do I approach developing programs?
This course required a lot of trial and error to position shapes, lighting, and textures properly. I had to adjust the X, Y, and Z coordinates multiple times to ensure my shapes were positioned and rotated correctly. This is the first course I have taken where every module has milestones that all lead to the completion of the final project in week 7. This gave me a new approach to the development process and made it easier to follow and complete the final project.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
This course provided me with knowledge that can be applied both professionally and educationally. Prior to starting this course, I heard that it was one of the most time consuming computer science courses at SNHU so I was prepared to finish a large chunk of the work ahead of time to allow myself to stay ahead of deadlines with plenty of cushion. This course allowed me to work on my scheduling to finish tasks ahead of time which will benefit me in both a professional and educational environment.
